### The chi-Squared Distribution (U)
- Remember Z -> for standard normal distrubtions
- Sum of squares of **K**  **independent** standard normal distributions
- **K** --> Degree of freedom
- E(U) -> **K**
- V(U) -> **2K**
- No -ve values
- Not symmetric graph
- **K** is the peak of the graph
- (alpha) --> area above (after)
  CDF always **1-**
- **F( X²*x,y***** ) --> Take F-¹ --> Use [[R]]
- Summing of chi-Squared also is chi-Squared of freedom (K1+K2...+Kn)

# Sampling Distribution
#Probability 
**They are all random variables**
## Population
### Values to know
- Population Mean → µ
- Population variance → œ 
-   Has parameters
### Definition
- Set of all elements under investigation
- Hard to define
- Can't contact and observe everyone realistically
### Examples
>- People voting in elections


## Sample
### Things to know
- Sample mean X (bar)
- Sample variance S²
- Has statistics (not parameters)
Each element within the sample itself is a random variable with its own E(x) and Variance
- Readings/Observations (x1,x2....etc)

- Sample size affects Variance but not the Mean (µ)
### Definition
- Subset of population
- Much easier to observe 
- Cheaper and Faster
- Serves as a testing ground before doing the real thing
### Examples
>- Asking 10 random people from each category

### Random Sample
- Must be random 
- All statistics are independent 
- Unbiased
- Representative
  must reflect whole population (All categories)
- Conditions
  1. X1,X2....Xn are all independent 
     See [[Joint probability|Independent random variables]]
  2. X1,X2,X3....Xn have the same distribution
     E(X1) = E(X2) = E(X3) = µ etc
     V(X1) = V(X2) = V(X3) = œ² etc
 independent and identically distributed
 ### Rules
 1. E(Xbar) = µ
 2. V(Xbar) = œ²/n
 
### X(bar) Distribution
1. Any Random Sample from [[Normal (Gaussian) Distribution|normal distribution]] Normal(µ, œ²) have sample mean X(bar) where X(bar) ~ Normal(µ, œ²/n) 
   Standard form:![[Pasted image 20221009234429.png]]
2. Central limit theorem
   Any random sample with a mean µ and variance œ² is normal when the sample size is large enough (n ≥ 30)
   
## Estimation
### Definition
- Literally in the name lol
- Chapter 2
### Examples
- How you know when Trams are coming 

## Confidence
- Interval that we get for population from samples
- Chapter 3

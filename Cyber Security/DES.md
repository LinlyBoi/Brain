# DES
> Symmetric Encryption $\rightarrow$ Same key
> $64$ bit key but in reality its $56$ bit because $8^{th}$ bit is ignored (Dumb)
> Block Encryption $\rightarrow$ Split message into equal size blocks and encrypt
> Stream Ciphers $\rightarrow$ not equal sizes just constantly getting data
## How it works 
>Turn key to bits  $\rightarrow$ Create subkeys
>Turn plain text to bits and split in half $\rightarrow$ Apply algorithm
## Why it sucks
>4-5 Days to brute force
>Small key size
## How to improve 
> BIGGER Key
> Triple DES time

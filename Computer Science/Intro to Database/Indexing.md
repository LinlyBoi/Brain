#Database 
## Index 
Used to rerive data from db more quickely than otherwise.
User cannot see indexes: updating with index takes more time than without index.

## Clustered index
index created on non-primary key columns which may not be unique.
(Group 2 or more columns)
## Non-cluster / secondary index
just tells us where the data lies (BRUH).

## Linked List
### Single Linked List
> consists of nodes
> node has data value and reference that points to next node (Link)
> No fixed size
> First node $\rightarrow$ head
### Double Linked List
> Every node points to next and previous nodes 
> Has Head and Tail (Last node)
> Head prev is null
> Tail next is null
### Circular
> Head points to Tail (prev)
> Tail points to head (next) 
> Can loop infinitely

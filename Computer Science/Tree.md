# Trees
## Basic Tree (Binary)
>- Consists of nodes (each node has child nodes)
>- Binary Tree $\rightarrow$ Each node has **AT MOST** 2 children
>- Bigger on right smaller on left (0, 1)
>- Searching in tree is very easy
>- Deleting a single node but keeping the children (you take the children from right to left so its sorted and insert them again from root)

#Programming
# [[Abstraction]]
> Take most significant attributes of an entity

# Inheritance
> Software reusability and extensibility 
> Add to an already existing without having to rewrite common properties
> Can modify an array of subclasses by changing super class only
## [[Polymorphism]]

# Wrapper Classes 
> Allow

# Object Class
# Encapsulation
# UML and Class Relationships
> Is a $\rightarrow$ Inheritance
> Has a $\rightarrow$ Putting object in another class/object
> Association relation $\rightarrow$ different object as method argument
> Aggregation $\rightarrow$ weak has a (Has it but doesn't **NEED ITTTT**)
> Person has a lawyer but can exist without a lawyer
> Aggregation can occur between same class (see linked list nodes)
> Composotion $\rightarrow$ String has-a/owns-a relationship 
> Table has a leg and can't exist without legs LOLOLLOLOLOL

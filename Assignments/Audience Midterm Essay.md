$\qquad$Since 2020 and the beginning of the pandemic live streams and live streaming platforms have gained a lot of popularity as it gave people a way to enjoy new content every day and satisfy their need to interact with others without risking their lives.

$\qquad$Live streaming platforms allow content creators to broadcast themselves to others around the world with the ability to identify what kind of content they provide to attract the right audience such as music, "just chatting", gaming and many other forms of content.
Moreover, these platforms offer a way for the audience to interact directly with the content creator through features like a live chat that the creator can read in real-time and other custom features that can be unique to each creator. While the audience has the ability to interact directly with the creator they can choose not to and simply enjoy watching the content  actively or passively in the background while they are doing something else. These platforms heavily rely on catering content to the right demographics by providing the categories for the content for example one of these platforms "Twitch" sorts the content shown on the main page based on the most popular categories which are usually "Just chatting" and the most popular games at the time however almost always the "Just chatting" category is shown to new users as it is one of the main selling points of the platform to be able to interact with creators and other audience members from the comfort of their home.

$\qquad$In addition, Twitch among other platforms allows filtering content by the language spoken as well to ensure that all audience members from different regions speaking different languages can find a community and a content creator they can enjoy. Popularity of content creators also is an important factor as the audience size for each stream varies based on how popular a creator is and the experience can vary depending on said "viewer count", larger creators are much more enjoyable to watch passively or to purely interact with other community members as it is much less likely to interact with the creator when there are thousands other in the live stream chat, however the popularity of said creators is because they are established personalities that are entertaining to be around without directly interacting, while others may enjoy watching smaller creators as it is more of a relaxing hangout with a few strangers that have similar interests.

$\qquad$In a nutshell, live streaming platforms provide audiences with content to enjoy and allows them to filter based on their interests and culture while also providing a way to satisfy their need to communicate with others without much effort.

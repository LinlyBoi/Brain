#ComputerVision 
>Vision: Is process of discovering what's present in the world and where it's by looking.
>Computer Vision: is the study of analysis of pictures and videos in order to achieve results similar to those as by human.

### Types of rays:
1. Gamma: Telescope or stars & Bacteria
2. X rays
3. Ultraviolet
4. Visible light (Optical): used in colour (RGB)
5. Infrared: Thermal
6.  Microwaves: For large lands Ex: Helicopter takes photo from sky
7. Radio waves: Like image slices from the brain

### Camera Modelling
- Pinhole Camera (Like we took in middle school):
    Abstract camera model box with small hole in it with light
- Lenses
- Camera Parameters and Calibration

### Pinhole camera
>Projection(Means delete dimention):
    So image of object should be 2D (Projection)
    So if we have object A have (X,Y,Z) 
    image of A = Ấ with 2D dimension (x̄,ȳ) which x̄ = X/Z and ȳ=Y/Z
    Z should be negative
>Homogeneous Coordination : 
    Means add dimension
    Give the new add dim 1 or w
Image is upside down but not mirrored left to right
The single point that all the rays going through called Center of projection(focal point)

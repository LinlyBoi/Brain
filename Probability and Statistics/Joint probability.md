#Probability 
# Join probability
## Definition
>- Studying multiple experiments at once
>- Multiple [[Random variables]]
## PDF
>- $fxy$
>- Has same properties as normal PDF
>- Marginals have to be equal 1 (Regular PDFs of each variable alone)
>- $f(y) = \sum{f(x,y)}$ in terms of all values of $x$
## Independent random variables
>if $f(x,y) = f(x) \cdot f(y)$ for all values of $x$, $y$
>
## Conditional Joint probability
>Rule = Joint/Marginal of given (after the / in f(x/y))
>
## Mean
>- Constants be  negative 
>- $E(x-y) = E(x) - E(y)$
>
## Variance
>- Constants always positive (squaring moment)
>- $V(x-y) = V(x) + V(y)$

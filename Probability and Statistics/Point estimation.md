# Point estimation
#Probability 
Statistics --> Descritptive and Inferential
Function of random sample that doesn't depend on unknown points --> Statistics
## Inference
- to make some conclusion based on incomplete information (educated guess)
- Conclusion about population from sample data
### Parameter estimation
- Point estimation --> µ (hat) = X(bar)
- θ is population parameter 
- θ(Hat) is function from sample data
#### How to get point estimate?
##### Method of Moment Estimation
- Method of [[Moment Generating Function|moment]] estimation
- In terms of population parameter
- µk = mk (Population moment = sample moment)
##### Maximum likelyhood estimation

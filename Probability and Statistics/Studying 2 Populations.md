￼# Estimation in R  
#Probability 
### Case of 2 populations
- Population with the bigger mean is first
  No -ve in probability
-   Relies on [[Random variables#Summation Properties|Summation properties]]
- We can replace $σ_1,σ_2$ with $S_1, S_2$ (Sample variance)
#### Cases:
1. Sample taken from normal population
   - $\bar X$ ~ N( µ, $\frac{σ²}{n}$ )
2. Sample taken from any distribution and n ≥ 30
   - $\bar X$ ~ N( µ, $\frac{σ²}{n}$ )
3. Sample taken from normal but sample n < 30
   - Use [[T distribution]]

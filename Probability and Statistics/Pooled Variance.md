#Probability 
```ad-tldr
Use when comparing 2 or more populations
Use when n$_1$ , n$_2$ < 30 and σ is unknown and σ$_1$  σ$_2$ are equal
```
- Definition:
  - Combined variance or Overall variance
- Unbiased estimator
- Tends to be closer to the sample variance of the bigger sample
```ad-hint
title: General Rule
### Sp² = $\frac{\sum{SS}}{\sum{df}}$

#### Sum squared (SS) = (X$_i$ + $\bar X$)²
#### Degrees of freedom (df) = n - 1 
```
```ad-question
title: Can we use this formula when n$_1$ ,n$_2$ ≥ 30?
YES
If σ² is unknown
```
```ad-question
title: Why can't we just take the average between S$_1$,S$_2$
We simply can't because we have to take into account the sample sizes
```

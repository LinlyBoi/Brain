# F distribution
#Probability 
- 2 normalised (divide their own K)[[The chi-Squared Distribution| Chi-squared]] divided each other 
- F is [[The chi-Squared Distribution|X²]] divide their own degrees of freedom
- Has 2 degrees of freedom
- Always positive 
- looks like [[The chi-Squared Distribution|Chi-squared]]
- Not symmetric
- Always skewed
- If no sample size just degrees of freedom
## Rules
- F = σ2²/σ1² . S1²/S2² ~ F(K1),(K2) --> In formula sheet eg gz
- F(f$_{α,n1,n2}$) = 1 - α
- f$_{α,n1,n2}$ =  1 / f$_{1-α,n1,n2}$

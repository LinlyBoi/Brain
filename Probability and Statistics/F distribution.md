# F distribution
#Probability 
- 2 [[The chi-Squared Distribution| Chi-squared]] divided each other
- F is [[The chi-Squared Distribution|X²]] divide their own degrees of freedom
- Has 2 degrees of freedom
- Always positive 
- looks like [[The chi-Squared Distribution|Chi-squared]]
- F = σ2²/σ1² . S1²/S2² ~ F(n1-1),(n2-1) --> In formula sheet eg gz
- F(f*α,n1,n2*) = 1 - α
- f*α,n1,n2* =  1 / f*1-α,n1,n2*
- Not symmetric
- Always skewed
- If no sample size just degrees of freedom

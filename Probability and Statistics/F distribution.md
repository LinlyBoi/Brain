# F distribution
#Probability 
- 2 normalised (divide their own K)[[The chi-Squared Distribution| Chi-squared]] divided each other 
- F is $\chi$ divide their own degrees of freedom
- Has 2 degrees of freedom
- Always positive 
- looks like [[The chi-Squared Distribution|Chi-squared]]
- Not symmetric
- Always skewed
- If no sample size just degrees of freedom
## Rules
- F = $\frac{σ_2²}{σ_1²}$ . $\frac{S_1²}{S_2²}$ ~ F$_{K1,K2}$ --> In formula sheet eg gz
- F(f$_{α,n1,n2}$) = 1 - α
- f$_{α,n1,n2}$ =  $\frac{1}{f_{1-α,n1,n2}}$

# F distribution
#Probability 
- 2 normalised (divide their own K)[[The chi-Squared Distribution| Chi-squared]] divided each other 
- F is $\chi$ divide their own degrees of freedom
- Has 2 degrees of freedom
- Always positive 
- looks like [[The chi-Squared Distribution|Chi-squared]]
- Not symmetric
- Always skewed
- If no sample size just degrees of freedom
## Rules
- $F = \frac{\sigma_2^2}{\sigma_1^2} \cdot \frac{S_1^2}{S_2²} \sim F_{K1,K2}$ $\rightarrow$ In formula sheet eg gz
- $F(f_{\alpha,n1,n2}) = 1 - \alpha$
- $f_{α,n1,n2}$ =  $\frac{1}{f_{1-\alpha,\,n1,\,n2}}$

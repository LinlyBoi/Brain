#Probability

# What are random variables?
> a function that associates a real number with each element in sample space (element X occurs N amount of time function)
> If range is countable(finite) it is a discrete random variable

## Discrete Probability distribution
###  1. Probability Mass Function
> f(x) >= 0
>  summation of f(x) = 1

### 2. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
> Non-decreasing function taking values in interval [0,1]
> CDF(x) = Summation of PDF(x) from 0 to x

## Mean and Variance
### The Mean (Expectation)
> its the average value 
>  **M** = E(x) = Summation x.f(x)  
>  Its probability usually close to the highest probable value

### The Variance
> How far values are from the mean **M**
> V(x) = E(x^2) - **M**^2
> Standard deviation  = root of V(x)

### Summation Properties
> E(ax+b) = aE(x^2) + b
> V(ax+b) = a^2 . V(x)

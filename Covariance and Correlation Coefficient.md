# Probability II 
- Systematic
- More statistics Less probability
- R -> For statistics
- [x] Join team
## Course Grade distribution
- 20 Midterm
- 5 attendance Lab
- 10 Lab Quizes/Assignments
- Bonus project (10)
- Final 60 -> Practical 20, Analytical 40 (IN THE LAB WITH COMPUTERS)
Relies on:
1. [[Random variables]]
2. [[Moment Generating Function]]
3. Most important distribution: [[Normal (Gaussian) Distribution]]
4. Use R to get CDF of [[Normal (Gaussian) Distribution|Normal Distribution]]
## Covariance
### Definition
 - How related two events are
 - If equal to 0 completely unrelated
 - Covariance value has no real meaning
 - **E( (x-µx) - (y-µy) )**
### Examples
 *insert image here*
- Ice cream sales increase when it is summer

## Correlation Coefficient
- Defines strength of relationship between the two events
  ![[Pasted image 20221003154156.png]]
- Perfect negative correlation -> when x >> then << y (increase/decrease a LOT)
- Perfect positive correlation -> when x >> then y >>
- Rule: **Covariance of the 2 variables/ product of standard deviations**

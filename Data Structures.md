#DataStructures

# Linked List
## Single Linked List
- consists of nodes
- node has data value and points to next node
- No fixed size
- First node -> head
## Double Linked List
- Every node points to next and previous nodes 
- Has Head and Tail (Last node)
- Head prev is null
- Tail next is null
## Circular
- Head points to Tail (prev)
- Tail points to head (next) 
- Can loop infinitely

# Stack and Queue
## Stack
- Last in First out (LIFO)
- no fixed size
- Push to add, Pop to return value and remove
- Peek -> see last
- Think of stack of books 
- Ex: print array in reverse
## Queue
- First in First out
- No fixed size
- Offer to add, Poll to return value and remove

- People are bored and look for something to break the boredom

# Excitement
- People aspire to reach an “ideal mental state”
# Alternative Experience
- Some people enjoy experiencing things from a different perspective 
  1. Spectate 
  2. Watching movies (horror etc)

# Catharsis
- Getting rid of underlying feelings like fear
- Purification or purity 
## Success Factors
### Individual differences between viewers
   - More useful to more creative people with imaginations
   - Non creative people rely on realistic allying in their feelings
### Full verification of emotion in the scene
   - How it provokes the audience’s feeling and the effect it has –> tense,anger etc
   - Some levels of complex arousal can’t be satisfied with alternative experiences
### Audience awareness 
   - Audience benefits when content is relatable
   - The “Balance” –> relating but also realising this is a dramatic recreation that is exaggerated
### The Moral message
   - the moral significance affects the spectator consciously or unconsciously 
   - “Tom&Jerry” criticised for having violence exposed to kids but it also taught so many values
   - Censorship exists to refuse any products that have a negative impact on spectators

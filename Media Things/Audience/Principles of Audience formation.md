- [ ] Finish writing this from thingy ðŸ“… 2022-12-06 
## Reasons Of Media Use
- Televisions
	Television attracts most audience â€“> because of its size and economic/social significance
	Harder to track televisions because many people share same TV
- Newspapers actively trying to actively recruit and keep a loyal fan base
- Canâ€™t answer questions about personal motivations without resorting to media sources
- Structural tradition emphasises media and social system as primary determinants
- Structural (functionalist) approach â€“> take individual needs,motives as starting point  
- General patterns and what actually happens are somewhat disjoint 
### Structural Approach to Audience Formation 
```ad-tldr
- Media is largely shaped by social and media structure elements 
- Social structure: "social facts" (education etc) 
- Media Structure: channels, choices and content available at given time
- Media system responds to pressures and feedback from audience to remain stable
```

### Functionalist Model
```ad-tldr
Uses and Gratifications Approach
- depends on percieved satisfactions, needs, wishes or motives of audience
- Audiences form based on similarties
- Psychological origins 
```

### Uses and Gratifications
```ad-tldr
- Cognitive needs
- Social Needs
- Non social needs "escape reality"
- Information seeking
```

```ad-warning
Not accurate , little success with model predictions and such.
Works best with relation to specific types of content. Selective attention to political content etc.

```

## Media Side Of Things
- Media is too situational and random to actually predict 
### Expectancy Value Theory 
```ad-tldr
Media use is accounted 
if the Gratification Sought is higher than the Gratifications Periceived (expected) higher Audience traction is more likely and higher scores of audience appreciation is present.
```

- Part of [[Digital Video Production]]
# Main Camera settings
- Aperature –> how wide the shutter opens
- ISO
- Shutter speed –> How fast the lens “clicks”
  1. Faster better to not let in too much light
  2. May want slower to capture more light (darker environment)
- Editing and colour grading needs good picture to begin with

# Lighting
- Ratio of highlight and shadow
- Features affect how lighting falls (we’re not just spheres)
- Shooting through soft material –> Cool damp effect (filters irl)
## 3 point lighting
- Key light
- Fill light
- Background light

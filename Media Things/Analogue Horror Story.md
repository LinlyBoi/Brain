## Story

A student with the latest technology of AI cameras came to film an ad/documentary for the local business, while filming the footage begins to bug out and show hints of the past murder that occurred in this exact location due to the footage being part of the AI data set,
For a brief moment the footage began to capture bloodstains that weren't there and other pieces of furniture that weren't exactly reminiscent of a business office but rather an old clinic, panicking  *Mustafa* rushed out of the office to call Amr his detective friend to tell him about what happened.

An hour later, Amr & Mustafa head to the office to further unravel what was going on, they begin filming in the same area where Mustafa initially saw the bloodstains and after many trials of different angles and distance they slowly begin to find "glitches" in the footage and reveal more details about the "clinic". 

Later that day, Amr calls the police station to further investigate about the possibility of a case relating to a clinic in this specific area, only to discover that there was a cold case from 20 years ago about a doctor who was killed with no evidence pointing to the killer.

The next day, Amr & Mustafa head to the office one last time to put all the pieces together, they start to film again with the camera and moving around the office furniture so the puzzle pieces are all put together to find out that the weapon used to kill the doctor was in a hidden compartment under his desk floor panels.

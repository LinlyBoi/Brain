# Linear Model
- Sender Transmits Message –> Through Mass Media Channel –>To Receivers (Audience)
- Gatekeepers (news editors -> [[News Editing and Blogging]]) act as filters to what actually gets sent to who [[Audience Research and Analysis#Targeted Media vs Not Targeted|Targeting audience]]
- Allows for feedback: 
  1. Audience commenting/sending emails (letter to the editor etc)
  2. Phone calls
  3. Web posts
  4. Talk shows
- Problem: The message does not reach the audience smoothly -> [[Digital Mass Communication#Noise in communication"|Noise]]
- No control over how the message is decoded or understood
# Cultural Model
- Individuals bring meanings to message
- Different people decode messages differently based on
  1. Gender
  2. Age
  3. Education
  4. Occupation
- Showcases complexity of how Senders lack control over how people react 
- Consumers shape media to fit or support their views –> **Selective Exposure**
- People with specific political opinions tend to seek posts that further support their preexisting views –> Confirmation bias

### Story itself
	In a world where the sun never existed what we once knew as the moon has erupted from within to supply the "Solar system" with little light for our planet Earth to thrive and evolve, few earthlings were blessed with the ability to teleport one of which is Max a rather curious young boy who enjoys analysing the things around him and creating solutions for his daily needs. Max is loved by his family and acquaintances; he doesn't have many friends as he is too busy drowning himself in work and research. Max has difficulty making friends as he often finds himself condescending others who seem to know a lot less than him and he does not believe in sugarcoating things. 
	
	One day Max discovers that some of his family members can actually teleport and later discovers he also has that talent and uses that ability to gather more things from around planet to study, Despite the lack of sun in this world the earthlings were able to bake and made what we know as "Pizzas". On one of Max's expeditions to find new things to study he comes across a spiky fruit that doesn't seem edible at all however he brought it back home for further analysis and finds out its soft and sweet core that he cut into many pieces to share with his family members who promptly refused to try it out of fear "it could be poison" they said however Max didn't have said fear and eats it and grows quite the liking for the fruit to a point where he actually tries it on Pizza while everyone looked at him with disgust
	Max mashes various materials to mix colors and grows a liking to what we know as pastel purple and chooses it for all his designs and branding
	One day it starts raining and that was never to be seen before which got Max very curious so he chose to attempt to teleport to the nearest point to the source of light that is now no longer seen and replaced with a rain of liquid and he noticed that the spark on the moon is slowly fading with his gadgets and with that he decided that he would attempt to find a solution to this and somehow rebuild the moon with a spark that never dies.

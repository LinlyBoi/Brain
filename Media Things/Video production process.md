# Video production process
Story -> Script -> Story board (Graph) -> Filming -> Video editing 
- Keep in mind [[Audience Analysis Factors|Audience]] you're targetting

## Storytelling
- Start with “What if”
- Protagonist and side characters (CASUALS)
- What the protagonist wants/needs (may be different)
- Obstacle
## Different ways
-  Pixar
	- Once upon a time … -> Because -> until finally

# Lighting
- Ratio of highlight and shadow
- Features affect how lighting falls (we’re not just spheres)
- Shooting through soft material –> Cool damp effect (filters irl)

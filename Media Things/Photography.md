# Photography
- Part of [[Video production process]]
## Main settings
- Aperature –> how wide the shutter opens
- ISO
- Shutter speed –> How fast the lens “clicks”
  1. Faster better to not let in too much light
  2. May want slower to capture more light (darker environment)
- Editing and colour grading needs good picture to begin with

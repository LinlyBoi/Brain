### Case of 2 populations
- Population with the bigger mean is first
  No -ve in probability
-   Relies on [[Random variables#Summation Properties|Summation properties]]
- We can replace (sigma)1,(sigma)2 with S1,S2 (Sample variance)
#### Cases:
- its all normal OR n ≥ 30
- 
1. Sample taken from normal population
2. Sample taken from any distribution and n ≥ 30
   x(bar) ~ N( µ, (sigma)/n )
3. Sample taken from normal but sample n < 30

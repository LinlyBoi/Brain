## Things to do 
- [ ] Load balancer container (Nginx proxy manager/Kemp)
      This won't work without a domain 
      Unless a local DNS is setup? (Why would you even do this)
- [ ]  Show Dr. Yasser libkyy.cf load balancing for demonstration

- [ ] Clarify why the router actually matters
      1. Private IP addresses so cluster never resets
      2. Static IP address
      3. Firewall configuration
      4. Port forwarding (1 port needed for now)
      5. Isolate devices from lab computers
      6. Subnetting
- [ ] Learn about shared volumes
- [ ]  Explain services that will be on servers
      1. Load balancer
      2. Website
      3. VPN server (not now)
      4. Docker image registry (locally built images also not now)
      5. File sharing (Plex etc)

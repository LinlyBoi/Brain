# R programming things
## Why are there libraries?
- Having all the code at once increases program build times
- Only build program with code you need
## R libraries in Prob II
### dplyr
- Data cleaning/filtration
### statsr
- Provides dummy data with standards
### ggplot
- Visualisation of data
## Plots
- Standard: just a line
- Stairs plot: Like [[Continuous Random variables |Cumulative distribution function]]
- Histogram plot: Used to display frequency (kind of like box plot too)
  1. provides us with probability distribution
  2. Mean
  3. Min/Max
## Values we need
1. Mean
2. Median (Needs data to be arranged ascending)
3. Standard deviation ()
4. First quantile 
   Value bigger than 25% of the data and smaller than 75% `Q1`
5. 3rd quantile 
   Value bigger than 75% of the data and bigger than 25% `Q3`
6. Inter quantile range `Q3-Q1`
   Values between the 3rd and the 1st Quantile
7. 2nd Quantile is the **median**
8. Mode (most repeated value)
## Types of Histograms
### Uni Modal and Bi Modal 
- Depends on how many peaks it has
### Left or Right skewed
## Pipe lining
### Definition
- Calling a value to "pipe" into another command/function
### Different programming languages and piping
- literally `ls | grep x`  in bash
- var %>% (*rest of code here*) in [[#R programming things|R programming language]]
## Sampling Data
- Independent sample (Must include all ranges)
- Avoid confirmation bias
- Make programming tool take the sample (random no bias)
 
# Things to do
- [ ] Install R packages (dplyr,statsr,ggplot)

## ER Diagram notes
- Document assumptions you've made

### Case of 2 populations
- Population with the bigger mean is first
  No -ve in probability
-   Relies on [[Random variables#Summation Properties|Summation properties]]
- We can replace (sigma)1,(sigma)2 with S1,S2 (Sample variance)
#### Cases:
- its all normal OR n â‰¥ 30
- 
1. Sample taken from normal population
2. Sample taken from any distribution and n â‰¥ 30
   x(bar) ~ N( Âµ, (sigma)/n )
3. Sample taken from normal but sample n < 30


### The chi-Squared Distribution (U)
- Remember Z -> for standard normal distrubtions
- Sum of squares of **K**  **independent** standard normal distributions
- **K** --> Degree of freedom
- E(U) -> **K**
- V(U) -> **2K**
- No -ve values
- Not symmetric graph
- **K** is the peak of the graph
- (alpha) --> area above (after)
  CDF always **1-**
- **F( XÂ²*x,y***** ) --> Take F-Â¹ --> Use [[R]]
- Summing of chi-Squared also is chi-Squared of freedom (K1+K2...+Kn)
  
### SÂ² distribution
> (n-1)SÂ²/(sigma)Â² ~ XÂ²(n-1)

E(SÂ²) -> (sigma)Â²
V(SÂ²) -> (sigma)^4/(n-1)

# T distribution
#Probability 
- T has the root at bottom
- Standard normal divided by root of [[The chi-Squared Distribution|chi-squared]] by its degree of freedom
- Final result --> ( (xbar) - µ )/ ( S/ (root)n ) ~ t(n-1)
- Like normal with heavier tail
- Use when σ unknown and n < 30
- Population normal 
- Symmetric curve --> has negative values
-  [[Normal (Gaussian) Distribution|Normal distribution]] with heavier tail
- When n ≥ 30 --> T is the standard normal
- F(t*α*) = 1 - α
- Get α by taking inverse value --> use [[R]]
  
  # F distribution
- 2 [[The chi-Squared Distribution| Chi-squared]] divided each other
- F is [[The chi-Squared Distribution|X²]] divide their own degrees of freedom
- Has 2 degrees of freedom
- Always positive 
- looks like [[The chi-Squared Distribution|Chi-squared]]
- F = σ2²/σ1² . S1²/S2² ~ F(n1-1),(n2-1) --> In formula sheet eg gz
- F(f*α,n1,n2*) = 1 - α
- f*α,n1,n2* =  1 / f*1-α,n1,n2*
- Not symmetric
- Always skewed
- If no sample size just degrees of freedom
# Point estimation
Statistics --> Descritptive and Inferential
Function of random sample that doesn't depend on unknown points --> Statistics
## Inference
- to make some conclusion based on incomplete information (educated guess)
- Conclusion about population from sample data
### Parameter estimation
- Point estimation --> µ (hat) = X(bar)
- θ is population parameter 
- θ(Hat) is function from sample data
#### How to get point estimate?
##### Method of Moment Estimation
- Method of [[Moment Generating Function|moment]] estimation
- In terms of population parameter
- µk = mk (Population moment = sample moment)
##### Maximum likelyhood estimation
#### Properties of Estimates

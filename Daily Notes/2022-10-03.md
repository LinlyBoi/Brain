## [[Random variables]]
## [[Moment Generating Function]]
- Most important distribution: [[Normal (Gaussian) Distribution]]
- Use R to get CDF of [[Normal (Gaussian) Distribution|Normal Distribution]]
## Covariance
### Definition
 - How related two events are
 - If equal to 0 completely unrelated
 - Covariance value has no real meaning
 - **E( (x-µx) - (y-µy) )**
### Examples
 *insert image here*
- Ice cream sales increase when it is summer

## Correlation Coefficient
- Defines strength of relationship between the two events
- Perfect negative correlation -> when x >> then << y (increase/decrease a LOT)
- Perfect positive correlation -> when x >> then y >>
- Rule: *get image screenshot of it here*

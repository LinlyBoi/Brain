	- Old school analogue (80-90s VHS tapes distortions etc)
	- Modern analogue horror: Cameras so good they see beyond what the naked eye sees

# Video production process
Story -> Script -> Story board (Graph) -> Filming -> Video editing 

## Storytelling
- Start with “What if”
- Protagonist and side characters (CASUALS)
- What the protagonist wants/needs (may be different)
- Obstacle
## Different ways
-  Pixar
	- Once upon a time … -> Because -> until finally


-  Marvel
	- Introduction to environment (World building)
## Project tasks
- [ ] Story
- [ ] Script with Storyboard
- [ ] Filming
- [ ] Editing (fix it in post lol)


# Lighting
- Ratio of highlight and shadow
- Features affect how lighting falls (we’re not just spheres)
- Shooting through soft material –> Cool damp effect (filters irl)

# Photography
## Main settings
- Aperature –> how wide the shutter opens
- ISO
- Shutter speed –> How fast the lens “clicks”
  1. Faster better to not let in too much light
  2. May want slower to capture more light (darker environment)
- Editing and colour grading needs good picture to begin with

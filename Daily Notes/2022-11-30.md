# SQL
```ad-tip
SQL deals with Sets with duplicates [[Sets#Multi-Sets|Multi-Sets]] and calls them bags
```

```ad-important
title: Conditions Involving Relations
- IN   -> '=' 
- ALL -> 'AND' 
- ANY -> 'OR'
- EXISTS -> NOT NULL
- NOT -> Negates any of above
- LIKE
```
# Aggregation
- Does things that we do in Data Science and [[R]]
- Counting columns can be useful as it will skip nulls
- COUNT is the only one that handles multiple columns
- Written **after** SELECT clause 
```SQL
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT,col_NAME) FROM Sailors;
```

```ad-hint
title: Aggregation Operators
- COUNT [Distinct] COLUMN
- SUM [Distinct] COLUMN
- AVG [Distinct] COLUMN
- MAX COLUMN
- MIN COLUMN

```

# Conceptual Query Evaluation
```ad-tip
title: Steps
1. Compute cross product of relation-list
2. Discrad resulting tuples if they fail qualifications
3. Delete attributes that are not in the target-list (column-list)
4. if DISTINCT specified, eliminate duplicate rows.
```
- Evaluates qualifications row by row
# Sub Queries 
- DBMS has query optimisation but sometimes that isn't enough
- Joins are expensive
- Dividing joins into smaller queries first before joining
- Utilises nested queries (SELECT in SELECT etc.)
- Usually present in the WHERE clause

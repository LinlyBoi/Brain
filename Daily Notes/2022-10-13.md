## Audience
- Receivers of any form of media (listeners,viewers etc)
- With the Internet, you can no longer accurately define the audience completely
  (people lie on the internet)
- The word is kept for familiarity but the definition is slowly diminishing.
- Audience is observed in fragmented or indirect ways -> [[Sampling Distribution| Sampling]]
- Constantly changing and trends shift very quickly
- Old Novel readers (18th century) , Tv viewers(late 20th) , Youtube viewers are all audiences (21st).
- Audience is defined by their social context -> having shared interests, understandings and information needs (Culture/Religion)

### Ways to define Audience
1. Place
2. People -> Age,Gender, etc.
3. Type of medium 
4. Content of message -> Genres
5. Time -> Cinema vs Public performers (Temporary Audience vs Permanent)
   - Short term Audience -> Not intending to consume media (passing by)
   - Prime-time audience -> Intended to consume media (bought a ticket etc.)

## Targeted Media vs Not Targeted
- All media reaches the "targeted" audience even if it wasn't intentional
- Drama based media does not target a specific audience (otherwise it would lose a big chunk of their viewership)

## Factors affecting Media success
- Moral message
